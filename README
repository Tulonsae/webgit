webgit is just another clone of Gitweb, the official GIT web client.

It is written in PHP5 due to its availability on most hosts. It uses the glip
PHP5 library that interacts with GIT repositories directly, no calls to the git
CLI client.

The other existing PHP clients are either broken or do not implement some
features I like (ie. checking for git-daemon-export-ok for use with gitosis).
That said, this is a work in progress and is incomplete also!
